<p begin="00:01:30:920" end="00:01:33:960">The financial industry<br/>touches everyone&apos;s life.</p>
<p begin="00:01:34:000" end="00:01:35:840">Prices rise and fall every day.</p>
<p begin="00:01:35:960" end="00:01:37:640">People have been through<br/>many financial crises.</p>
<p begin="00:01:37:720" end="00:01:38:920">Some have won, some have lost.</p>
<p begin="00:01:39:000" end="00:01:41:720">Yet Hong Kong remains<br/>an international financial center.</p>
<p begin="00:01:41:880" end="00:01:46:400">But do all the economic indexes really<br/>reflect the livelihood of the people?</p>
<p begin="00:01:46:480" end="00:01:48:320">Some people say numbers don&apos;t lie.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48:480" end="00:01:51:880">But are there people<br/>who manipulate them behind the scene?</p>
<p begin="00:01:52:560" end="00:01:53:720">Here comes Mr Cheuk...</p>
<p begin="00:01:53:800" end="00:01:56:800">Mr Cheuk...</p>
<p begin="00:02:01:640" end="00:02:03:280">Mr Cheuk, you&apos;re barely over<br/>thirty years old.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03:400" end="00:02:05:560">You&apos;re already the chairman of<br/>Brainman Group.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05:680" end="00:02:07:640">You even won the title of<br/>&quot;Alchemist of the Financial Sector&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:02:07:760" end="00:02:09:080">two years in a row.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09:200" end="00:02:12:920">The financial world is so complicated.<br/>How can you make yourself so outstanding?</p>
<p begin="00:02:13:040" end="00:02:16:240">I&apos;ve simply been luckier than other people<br/>to achieve what I have today.</p>
<p begin="00:02:16:400" end="00:02:18:520">Actually I haven&apos;t met<br/>many of my targets yet.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18:680" end="00:02:21:880">But today I want to share with everyone</p>
<p begin="00:02:22:040" end="00:02:27:200">the idea that greed is the driving force<br/>of progress. Greed is motivation.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27:320" end="00:02:30:800">Greed is good? He&apos;s leading kids astray.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31:840" end="00:02:33:920">We live in a civilized society.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34:080" end="00:02:37:280">But in the financial world,<br/>it&apos;s as cruel as in a forest.</p>
<p begin="00:02:37:400" end="00:02:39:360">If you&apos;re not greedy,<br/>you&apos;ll be eaten by others.</p>
<p begin="00:02:39:440" end="00:02:41:840">Of course, during the kill,</p>
<p begin="00:02:41:920" end="00:02:44:960">you must observe the law<br/>and compete fairly.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45:080" end="00:02:46:680">You need integrity to get what you want.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51:040" end="00:02:53:520">Mentor, Wong Shiu-lung has shown up.</p>
<p begin="00:02:58:200" end="00:02:59:240">Action.</p>
<p begin="00:03:08:320" end="00:03:11:160">Wong Shiu-lung, Commercial Crime Bureau.</p>
<p begin="00:03:11:280" end="00:03:14:560">We suspect you&apos;re involved in<br/>a commercial fraud case. Hey...</p>
<p begin="00:03:19:000" end="00:03:22:400">So I will only be seventy percent full.<br/>I always stay hungry.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22:600" end="00:03:26:360">A person will stay alert<br/>only under scarcity and fear.</p>
<p begin="00:03:26:480" end="00:03:30:080">Then he&apos;ll find a way to survive<br/>and change himself.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30:400" end="00:03:31:360">Then he&apos;ll change the world.</p>
<p begin="00:03:31:480" end="00:03:33:360">Take care of the pregnant woman. Hey...<br/>Are you OK?</p>
<p begin="00:03:33:400" end="00:03:34:360">It really hurts.</p>
<p begin="00:03:49:400" end="00:03:50:760">Stop...</p>
<p begin="00:03:53:120" end="00:03:57:000">Stop...</p>
<p begin="00:04:00:960" end="00:04:01:800">Get out of my way.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01:840" end="00:04:04:360">What? The police are hitting people.<br/>Are cops above the law?</p>
<p begin="00:04:04:440" end="00:04:05:600">You&apos;re doomed. Everyone saw this.</p>
<p begin="00:04:05:640" end="00:04:07:080">They shot it<br/>with their cell phones. Look.</p>
<p begin="00:04:10:920" end="00:04:14:040">You run really fast.<br/>Do run a marathon every year?</p>
<p begin="00:04:14:120" end="00:04:15:920">Sir, we just work for money.</p>
<p begin="00:04:16:040" end="00:04:17:760">I&apos;ll give you $5 million.<br/>Let me go.</p>
<p begin="00:04:17:840" end="00:04:19:840">That&apos;s it?</p>
<p begin="00:04:19:880" end="00:04:21:160">$10 million them.</p>
<p begin="00:04:22:840" end="00:04:24:120">How about $100 million?</p>
<p begin="00:04:24:200" end="00:04:27:200">Sir, can you really take that much?<br/>You&apos;re greedier than me.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27:240" end="00:04:28:800">Greed is good.</p>
<p begin="00:04:30:480" end="00:04:32:200">It&apos;s a deal.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32:240" end="00:04:33:600">Yeah...</p>
<p begin="00:04:35:520" end="00:04:39:640">Yeah? Do I look that greedy?<br/>Are rich people above the law?</p>
<p begin="00:04:39:800" end="00:04:41:920">Can you make your dead family<br/>come back to life with money?</p>
<p begin="00:04:42:000" end="00:04:43:800">Can you buy freedom with money?</p>
<p begin="00:04:43:880" end="00:04:48:080">I, Chow Sun-yung, of CCB am well known.<br/>You can&apos;t buy my integrity.</p>
<p begin="00:04:48:200" end="00:04:52:960">Besides, it&apos;s a breach of the law<br/>to take bribes. You want to trick me?</p>
<p begin="00:04:53:000" end="00:04:54:120">Mentor.</p>
<p begin="00:04:54:880" end="00:04:56:640">Take him in.</p>
<p begin="00:04:58:200" end="00:04:58:760">Go.</p>
<p begin="00:04:58:800" end="00:04:59:960">Don&apos;t move.</p>
<p begin="00:05:00:000" end="00:05:00:760">Go.</p>
<p begin="00:05:01:080" end="00:05:03:560">Would you choose greed<br/>to strengthen yourself</p>
<p begin="00:05:03:720" end="00:05:07:240">or be eliminated as a loser<br/>under the law of the jungle?</p>
<p begin="00:05:10:360" end="00:05:12:400">Wong Shiu-lung, we received reports<br/>that a year ago,</p>
<p begin="00:05:12:520" end="00:05:15:640">you, as an I-banker of<br/>Brainman Investment Bank</p>
<p begin="00:05:15:800" end="00:05:19:200">withheld material information and<br/>made misrepresentations</p>
<p begin="00:05:19:320" end="00:05:23:080">with the intent to defraud for profit<br/>when Engola International bought out</p>
<p begin="00:05:23:200" end="00:05:30:680">the Hong Kong listed mainland enterprise<br/>Big Light Year.</p>
<p begin="00:05:30:800" end="00:05:31:880">What&apos;s your response to the allegation?</p>
<p begin="00:05:31:960" end="00:05:36:080">I won&apos;t answer any of your questions<br/>without my lawyer present.</p>
<p begin="00:05:38:120" end="00:05:40:560">Brother Yung,<br/>Wong Shiu-lung&apos;s lawyer&apos;s here.</p>
<p begin="00:05:40:800" end="00:05:45:000">I&apos;m his lawyer Yip Kai-bun.<br/>I&apos;d like to speak to my client privately.</p>
<p begin="00:05:45:040" end="00:05:47:200">Fine. Tea time.</p>
<p begin="00:06:08:880" end="00:06:11:480">Got it. It&apos;s an 85 percent match.</p>
<p begin="00:06:11:560" end="00:06:14:200">Look. This is a wrong entry.</p>
<p begin="00:06:14:280" end="00:06:17:160">It&apos;s a 100 percent match<br/>after the adjustment.</p>
<p begin="00:06:17:240" end="00:06:20:080">Coffee time. It&apos;s Mentor Yung&apos;s treat.</p>
<p begin="00:06:20:160" end="00:06:20:920">Thank you, Mentor.</p>
<p begin="00:06:21:000" end="00:06:21:840">Thank you...</p>
<p begin="00:06:21:920" end="00:06:22:600">Thank you, Mentor.</p>
<p begin="00:06:22:880" end="00:06:25:680">Why is there only coffee?<br/>Mentor drinks tea.</p>
<p begin="00:06:25:720" end="00:06:27:840">Mentor gave the order. I just executed it.</p>
<p begin="00:06:27:880" end="00:06:29:000">There are no cakes?</p>
<p begin="00:06:29:040" end="00:06:35:600">Solar my friend, I, Chu Kwok-leung of CCB,<br/>am known to be generous.</p>
<p begin="00:06:35:720" end="00:06:36:720">Do you want to eat...?</p>
<p begin="00:06:36:800" end="00:06:38:720">Shut up. Mentor&apos;s thinking.</p>
<p begin="00:06:38:800" end="00:06:42:880">Do you guys believe what that I-banker<br/>Wong Shiu-lung said in his statement?</p>
<p begin="00:06:42:960" end="00:06:44:800">At first he refused to talk.</p>
<p begin="00:06:44:880" end="00:06:46:120">But after he met with his lawyer,</p>
<p begin="00:06:46:200" end="00:06:50:720">he then accused his group chairman<br/>and said Cheuk Yuk told him to do it.</p>
<p begin="00:06:50:840" end="00:06:52:520">He was just executing his instructions.</p>
<p begin="00:06:52:640" end="00:06:56:840">I think he wants to turn<br/>prosecution witness.</p>
<p begin="00:06:56:920" end="00:07:00:160">That&apos;s possible. Cheuk Yuk is very clever.<br/>We must be careful.</p>
<p begin="00:07:00:280" end="00:07:01:400">Yes, Mentor.</p>
<p begin="00:07:01:480" end="00:07:02:120">What&apos;s the progress?</p>
<p begin="00:07:02:280" end="00:07:03:640">Madam...</p>
<p begin="00:07:03:760" end="00:07:05:280">What have you got?</p>
<p begin="00:07:06:160" end="00:07:08:520">Madam, you just got off the plane.<br/>You came in to work right away.</p>
<p begin="00:07:08:600" end="00:07:10:480">Have some coffee to stay awake.</p>
<p begin="00:07:10:560" end="00:07:13:720">I&apos;m OK. Get the documents ready.<br/>Meeting in five minutes. Move.</p>
<p begin="00:07:13:840" end="00:07:15:720">Yes, Madam.</p>
<p begin="00:07:16:520" end="00:07:20:240">Too bad she&apos;s Madam Pushy.<br/>I wish she were Madam Slack.</p>
<p begin="00:07:20:440" end="00:07:23:000">This case is called Operation Tiger Hunting.</p>
<p begin="00:07:23:120" end="00:07:25:920">The case is complicated.<br/>It involves five companies.</p>
<p begin="00:07:26:040" end="00:07:27:760">We have to check a lot of info.</p>
<p begin="00:07:27:840" end="00:07:31:040">So I&apos;ve asked the boss to assign Ella<br/>from B Team to help us.</p>
<p begin="00:07:31:160" end="00:07:32:320">Hello, Ella.</p>
<p begin="00:07:32:400" end="00:07:33:000">Hi.</p>
<p begin="00:07:33:040" end="00:07:33:960">Please have a seat, Ella.</p>
<p begin="00:07:34:040" end="00:07:35:280">Thank you.</p>
<p begin="00:07:35:640" end="00:07:39:240">A year ago the US company Engola Enterprise<br/>wanted to venture into the Chinese market.</p>
<p begin="00:07:39:360" end="00:07:48:080">So they acquired a Chinese company<br/>called Big Light Year.</p>
<p begin="00:07:48:200" end="00:07:50:280">It&apos;s a Hong Kong listed company.</p>
<p begin="00:07:50:440" end="00:07:54:320">Brainman was the investment bank<br/>in this buyout.</p>
<p begin="00:07:54:520" end="00:07:57:760">Wong Shiu-lung was fully in charge<br/>of the transaction.</p>
<p begin="00:07:57:880" end="00:07:59:040">Big Light Year instructed</p>
<p begin="00:07:59:160" end="00:08:03:160">Ma Kwok-tung of<br/>Sin Man Keung Accountants as its auditor.</p>
<p begin="00:08:03:240" end="00:08:07:120">Engola is a big international enterprise.<br/>Still it got cheated. That&apos;s unbelievable.</p>
<p begin="00:08:07:240" end="00:08:08:280">They were very clever.</p>
<p begin="00:08:08:440" end="00:08:10:160">Throughout the entire process<br/>of the transaction,</p>
<p begin="00:08:10:280" end="00:08:13:000">they didn&apos;t disclose<br/>in any of Brainman&apos;s working files</p>
<p begin="00:08:13:160" end="00:08:17:440">that Big Light Year&apos;s wholly-owned<br/>subsidiary Little Comet was in debt.</p>
<p begin="00:08:17:520" end="00:08:22:000">Also, they made use of the discrepancies</p>
<p begin="00:08:22:120" end="00:08:24:400">in the accounting principles of Chinese and<br/>Western enterprises to hide many facts.</p>
<p begin="00:08:24:520" end="00:08:27:080">In the past couple of days,<br/>Madam and I have inspected Little Comet</p>
<p begin="00:08:27:200" end="00:08:29:680">with the assistance of<br/>Chinese law enforcement bodies.</p>
<p begin="00:08:29:800" end="00:08:32:160">The assets mentioned in the buyout</p>
<p begin="00:08:32:320" end="00:08:39:600">were just a deserted factory<br/>and a piece of undeveloped land.</p>
<p begin="00:08:39:720" end="00:08:43:400">The machines for production<br/>are just a bunch of scrap.</p>
<p begin="00:08:43:520" end="00:08:44:600">According to your instructions,</p>
<p begin="00:08:44:720" end="00:08:47:480">we brought in Ma Kwok-tung<br/>of Sin Man Keung Accountants</p>
<p begin="00:08:47:600" end="00:08:50:480">and Wong Shiu-lung of Brainman<br/>and asked them to give a statement.</p>
<p begin="00:08:50:600" end="00:08:52:880">Ma Kwok-tung has made<br/>a confession already.</p>
<p begin="00:08:52:960" end="00:08:54:760">It has nothing to do with<br/>the other partners of the accounting firm.</p>
<p begin="00:08:54:840" end="00:08:59:240">In the meantime we have no evidence to<br/>implicate the owner of the firm Sin Cho-wai.</p>
<p begin="00:08:59:320" end="00:09:01:000">For Wong Shiu-lung,<br/>there&apos;s a new development.</p>
<p begin="00:09:01:120" end="00:09:03:880">He&apos;s suddenly accused Brainman<br/>&apos;s chairmanCheuk Yuk</p>
<p begin="00:09:04:000" end="00:09:06:000">as the mastermind<br/>behind the entire incident.</p>
<p begin="00:09:06:160" end="00:09:07:200">Cheuk Yuk has become famous</p>
<p begin="00:09:07:320" end="00:09:09:320">in the financial sector<br/>these past three years.</p>
<p begin="00:09:09:440" end="00:09:12:800">Last year he joined the<br/>Stock Market Advisory Committee</p>
<p begin="00:09:12:920" end="00:09:14:560">as a committee member.</p>
<p begin="00:09:18:400" end="00:09:22:600">The biggest partner of<br/>Sin Man Keung Accountants</p>
<p begin="00:09:22:760" end="00:09:26:800">Sin Cho-wai is the vice-chairman of SMAC.</p>
<p begin="00:09:26:920" end="00:09:31:040">In other words, the people involved<br/>in this case are high profile.</p>
<p begin="00:09:31:120" end="00:09:34:240">This commercial fraud case involves<br/>more than $3.6 billion.</p>
<p begin="00:09:34:360" end="00:09:36:480">High ranking people are involved too.</p>
<p begin="00:09:36:560" end="00:09:40:280">I believe we&apos;ll discover more<br/>during the investigation.</p>
<p begin="00:09:40:440" end="00:09:46:840">Great. We&apos;re going into battle again.<br/>This time our new target is Cheuk Yuk.</p>
<p begin="00:09:47:720" end="00:09:48:760">Who are we?</p>
<p begin="00:09:49:360" end="00:09:52:800">CC Buddy, one heart one mind.</p>
<p begin="00:09:52:880" end="00:09:53:360">You&apos;re right.</p>
<p begin="00:09:53:440" end="00:09:54:560">OK. Let&apos;s go. It&apos;s a battle.</p>
<p begin="00:09:54:680" end="00:09:57:040">Let&apos;s go.</p>
<p begin="00:10:48:400" end="00:10:52:080">Honey, how does it feel up there?</p>
<p begin="00:10:52:160" end="00:10:54:360">Fly with me next time and you&apos;ll find out.</p>
<p begin="00:10:56:000" end="00:10:59:040">This morning you told us to speculate on<br/>three pharmaceutical penny stocks.</p>
<p begin="00:10:59:160" end="00:11:00:080">We&apos;re already working on it.</p>
<p begin="00:11:00:200" end="00:11:01:880">Good.</p>
<p begin="00:11:02:640" end="00:11:05:200">Boss Cheuk, I can&apos;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:11:05:320" end="00:11:07:720">you still care about making money<br/>even when you&apos;re high up in the sky.</p>
<p begin="00:11:07:800" end="00:11:09:040">Tiger, why don&apos;t you guess</p>
<p begin="00:11:09:120" end="00:11:12:680">how much Boss Cheuk can make<br/>in the ten minutes or so before he lands?</p>
<p begin="00:11:12:760" end="00:11:16:440">Figures are just a game.<br/>I&apos;m not interested in them.</p>
<p begin="00:11:16:600" end="00:11:22:480">But I wonder if the real world<br/>is like the virtual world.</p>
<p begin="00:11:22:600" end="00:11:27:160">When someone breaks the record,<br/>he&apos;ll win the whole world.</p>
<p begin="00:11:28:280" end="00:11:32:480">Anson, I see the big piece of land<br/>for North East Development.</p>
<p begin="00:11:32:640" end="00:11:35:240">Too bad we didn&apos;t have the capital<br/>until recent years.</p>
<p begin="00:11:35:400" end="00:11:37:200">The syndicates already started</p>
<p begin="00:11:37:280" end="00:11:39:280">building up land reserves in the<br/>New Territories more than ten years ago.</p>
<p begin="00:11:39:360" end="00:11:41:200">Boss Cheuk, I checked for you.</p>
<p begin="00:11:41:280" end="00:11:44:920">No one is selling the land in the<br/>North East Development at this moment.</p>
<p begin="00:11:45:000" end="00:11:48:480">But the accountant Sin Cho-wai<br/>you told me to check on</p>
<p begin="00:11:49:120" end="00:11:52:200">competed with the syndicates before.</p>
<p begin="00:11:52:320" end="00:11:53:960">He owns several nice pieces of land.</p>
<p begin="00:11:54:040" end="00:11:55:400">Good.</p>
<p begin="00:11:55:560" end="00:11:58:400">Good? You can&apos;t buy the land now.</p>
<p begin="00:11:58:520" end="00:12:01:200">Who says it&apos;s too late now?</p>
<p begin="00:12:21:080" end="00:12:22:080">Honey.</p>
<p begin="00:12:24:160" end="00:12:30:080">Boss Cheuk, look at your flying data.<br/>It would be perfect if it were windier today</p>
<p begin="00:12:30:240" end="00:12:33:760">You&apos;re the security chief of my company.<br/>You didn&apos;t go to work.</p>
<p begin="00:12:33:880" end="00:12:37:160">Instead, you came here to make me use<br/>your so-called flying data app.</p>
<p begin="00:12:37:320" end="00:12:39:320">You&apos;ve got me wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:12:39:440" end="00:12:44:440">To do my security job well, I must<br/>monitor everyone&apos;s computer system.</p>
<p begin="00:12:44:600" end="00:12:49:880">To me you&apos;re the most valuable asset<br/>of Brainman. So I must monitor you too.</p>
<p begin="00:12:50:080" end="00:12:52:560">Next time I&apos;ll do deep diving.<br/>Let&apos;s see how you&apos;ll monitor me.</p>
<p begin="00:12:52:680" end="00:12:54:600">Deep diving sounds really fun.</p>
<p begin="00:12:54:680" end="00:12:57:560">Let me go online and find out<br/>how I can get online in the deep sea.</p>
<p begin="00:12:57:640" end="00:13:00:160">Honey, when you were flying just now,</p>
<p begin="00:13:00:320" end="00:13:01:320">the prices of the three<br/>pharmaceutical stocks</p>
<p begin="00:13:01:440" end="00:13:02:080">rose by 40 percent.</p>
<p begin="00:13:02:160" end="00:13:04:400">You made $100 million.<br/>Good.</p>
<p begin="00:13:04:600" end="00:13:06:960">Hey, what are you checking?<br/>It&apos;s so easy to make money.</p>
<p begin="00:13:07:080" end="00:13:10:640">Normal investors have no idea<br/>what the pharmaceutical companies produce.</p>
<p begin="00:13:10:760" end="00:13:12:520">They don&apos;t know even if<br/>the companies produce diapers.</p>
<p begin="00:13:12:640" end="00:13:15:360">So long as someone leaks some intel,<br/>they&apos;ll follow the speculation.</p>
<p begin="00:13:15:440" end="00:13:16:800">People are like that because they&apos;re greedy.</p>
<p begin="00:13:16:920" end="00:13:19:960">But they&apos;re not smart enough.<br/>They&apos;re too passive.</p>
<p begin="00:13:20:080" end="00:13:22:320">You think everyone can<br/>play the banker like you?</p>
<p begin="00:13:22:400" end="00:13:25:360">They&apos;re just greedy.<br/>They rely on their luck.</p>
<p begin="00:13:25:440" end="00:13:27:680">Yes, Madam. Let&apos;s go eat breakfast.</p>
<p begin="00:13:38:240" end="00:13:39:080">Good morning, Mr Cheuk, Mrs Cheuk.</p>
<p begin="00:13:39:120" end="00:13:40:080">Good morning.</p>
<p begin="00:13:42:920" end="00:13:44:520">Good morning, Mr Cheuk, Mrs Cheuk.</p>
<p begin="00:13:44:600" end="00:13:46:280">Good morning, Mr Cheuk, Mrs Cheuk.</p>
<p begin="00:13:53:080" end="00:13:54:440">See you in the meeting later.</p>
<p begin="00:13:54:680" end="00:13:56:000">Mr Cheuk, Mrs Cheuk.</p>
<p begin="00:13:56:840" end="00:13:58:440">Mrs Cheuk, I&apos;ll go back to IT.</p>
<p begin="00:13:59:000" end="00:14:00:280">Good morning, Mr Cheuk.</p>
<p begin="00:14:00:320" end="00:14:01:400">Good morning.</p>
<p begin="00:14:02:440" end="00:14:03:800">Good morning, Mrs Cheuk.</p>
<p begin="00:14:04:000" end="00:14:05:000">Mr Cheuk.</p>
<p begin="00:14:11:880" end="00:14:13:840">Mr Cheuk, there&apos;s a regular meeting<br/>in ten minutes.</p>
<p begin="00:14:13:960" end="00:14:17:040">And you have five appointments today.<br/>The material for the meeting is ready.</p>
<p begin="00:14:17:080" end="00:14:17:600">OK.</p>
<p begin="00:14:17:680" end="00:14:18:960">Coffee&apos;s ready too.</p>
<p begin="00:14:20:640" end="00:14:23:920">Mr Cheuk, Mr Tsui gave you<br/>this book last night.</p>
<p begin="00:14:24:120" end="00:14:26:480">Master Fat published<br/>a new book again. Good.</p>
<p begin="00:14:26:640" end="00:14:29:200">I heard Gordon was arrested.</p>
<p begin="00:14:29:320" end="00:14:32:200">Just Wong Shiu-lung? How come?</p>
<p begin="00:14:33:680" end="00:14:36:040">Hey, what are you guys talking about?</p>
<p begin="00:14:36:160" end="00:14:37:160">Nothing.</p>
<p begin="00:14:37:240" end="00:14:38:440">Just chit-chat.</p>
<p begin="00:14:42:560" end="00:14:44:400">That talkative guy wants to get intel again.</p>
<p begin="00:14:44:480" end="00:14:47:920">Don&apos;t call him that.<br/>His nickname&apos;s Master Fat.</p>
<p begin="00:14:48:000" end="00:14:50:840">So? He&apos;s just a financial actor.</p>
<p begin="00:14:50:920" end="00:14:52:600">If Mr Cheuk hadn&apos;t given him that title,</p>
<p begin="00:14:52:680" end="00:14:55:920">given his capabilities, he wouldn&apos;t have a<br/>seat at the meeting with Mr Cheuk.</p>
<p begin="00:14:56:040" end="00:14:57:640">Never mind. We have room for him.</p>
<p begin="00:14:58:480" end="00:15:02:760">If there weren&apos;t financial PRs like us<br/>to do the talking in this profession,</p>
<p begin="00:15:02:840" end="00:15:04:760">how would you have such good momentum?</p>
<p begin="00:15:04:840" end="00:15:06:520">We&apos;re just doing our respective jobs.</p>
<p begin="00:15:06:600" end="00:15:11:440">Hey, I&apos;ve got something nice for you.<br/>An autographed copy of new book.</p>
<p begin="00:15:11:520" end="00:15:14:200">Don&apos;t throw it away.<br/>Your mother treats it like treasure.</p>
<p begin="00:15:14:280" end="00:15:14:920">Master Fat...</p>
<p begin="00:15:14:960" end="00:15:16:960">Master Fat, congratulations.</p>
<p begin="00:15:17:000" end="00:15:17:440">Mrs Cheuk.</p>
<p begin="00:15:17:480" end="00:15:18:200">You&apos;ve published a new book again.</p>
<p begin="00:15:18:240" end="00:15:19:240">Thank you, Mrs Cheuk. Thank you very much.</p>
<p begin="00:15:19:280" end="00:15:22:360">Patrick, I haven&apos;t received your report on<br/>the Asset Management Department yet.</p>
<p begin="00:15:22:440" end="00:15:24:360">I&apos;m sorry, Mrs Cheuk.<br/>I&apos;ll get it for you right away.</p>
<p begin="00:15:25:840" end="00:15:26:640">Raymond...</p>
<p begin="00:15:26:720" end="00:15:28:280">Mrs Cheuk, I&apos;ll get back to work.</p>
<p begin="00:15:28:400" end="00:15:32:400">Hey, you&apos;re so rude.<br/>He gave you his book.</p>
<p begin="00:15:32:520" end="00:15:37:000">Right. Thank you, Master Fat.</p>
<p begin="00:15:37:280" end="00:15:43:040">You&apos;re welcome...<br/>Mrs Cheuk, I&apos;ll get back to work.</p>
<p begin="00:15:48:480" end="00:15:50:720">Mrs Cheuk, this is the agenda<br/>for today&apos;s meeting.</p>
<p begin="00:15:50:840" end="00:15:52:960">OK. Let me know when the meeting can start.<br/>OK.</p>
<p begin="00:15:54:800" end="00:15:55:960">Mr Cheuk.</p>
<p begin="00:16:02:960" end="00:16:05:760">Wong Shiu-lung was arrested by CCB.<br/>I&apos;ve talked to him.</p>
<p begin="00:16:05:880" end="00:16:08:560">CCB wants to detain him for 48 hours.</p>
<p begin="00:16:08:640" end="00:16:11:280">He thinks I don&apos;t know he&apos;s fleecing us<br/>through the company projects?</p>
<p begin="00:16:11:360" end="00:16:14:200">I think CCB got a search warrant.<br/>They&apos;ll take action very soon.</p>
<p begin="00:16:14:280" end="00:16:15:840">Mr Cheuk, you need to be prepared for that.</p>
<p begin="00:16:15:920" end="00:16:18:480">I am. There must be sacrifices<br/>to achieve something big.</p>
<p begin="00:16:20:760" end="00:16:21:760">Let&apos;s go to the meeting.</p>
<p begin="00:16:31:560" end="00:16:33:080">Good morning, Mr Cheuk.</p>
<p begin="00:16:33:160" end="00:16:34:320">Let&apos;s start the meeting.</p>
<p begin="00:16:34:480" end="00:16:37:960">I hear the China Securities<br/>Regulatory Commission will...</p>
<p begin="00:16:53:320" end="00:16:55:720">Master Fat,say something to get us thinki<br/>ng.</p>
<p begin="00:16:55:800" end="00:16:58:480">There&apos;s a rumor that there&apos;ll be a battle<br/>over the acquisition of supermarkets.</p>
<p begin="00:16:58:600" end="00:17:00:040">How keen do you think it&apos;ll be?</p>
<p begin="00:17:00:120" end="00:17:02:880">There isn&apos;t much room for development in<br/>the retail business of local supermarkets.</p>
<p begin="00:17:02:960" end="00:17:05:400">It&apos;s quite attractive as the cash flow<br/>each day is so big.</p>
<p begin="00:17:05:480" end="00:17:07:560">Yet the interest rate is too low.<br/>There won&apos;t be much profit.</p>
<p begin="00:17:07:640" end="00:17:08:880">It&apos;s not the cash flow that&apos;s attractive.</p>
<p begin="00:17:09:000" end="00:17:12:000">What&apos;s most important now is that<br/>this is the era of big data.</p>
<p begin="00:17:12:080" end="00:17:14:880">As long as we can collect<br/>clients&apos; data and analyze it,</p>
<p begin="00:17:15:000" end="00:17:19:600">we can find out their different<br/>modes of consumption and living.</p>
<p begin="00:17:19:720" end="00:17:24:320">This can help many enterprises<br/>decide their marketing plans.</p>
<p begin="00:17:24:360" end="00:17:27:320">Shall we buy a supermarket group then?</p>
<p begin="00:17:29:760" end="00:17:32:720">Mr Cheuk, the CCB officers are here.</p>
<p begin="00:17:32:760" end="00:17:34:040">Bring them here.</p>
<p begin="00:17:34:160" end="00:17:35:720">Meeting adjourned. Get back to work.</p>
<p begin="00:17:41:920" end="00:17:45:320">Mr Cheuk Yuk, I&apos;m inspector Ho Sheung-yee<br/>of Commercial Crime Bureau.</p>
<p begin="00:17:45:480" end="00:17:47:280">Engola Group has filed a report with us.</p>
<p begin="00:17:47:400" end="00:17:49:960">We suspect Brainman Group&apos;s management<br/>of being involved in fraud</p>
<p begin="00:17:50:080" end="00:17:51:880">and making misrepresentations.</p>
<p begin="00:17:52:000" end="00:17:54:920">This is a search warrant.<br/>Your cooperation is appreciated.</p>
<p begin="00:17:54:960" end="00:17:56:480">No problem. We&apos;ll do whatever we can<br/>to accommodate your requests.</p>
<p begin="00:17:56:560" end="00:17:57:680">Thank you.</p>
<p begin="00:17:57:760" end="00:18:00:320">Hello, Madam. I&apos;m Mrs Cheuk.<br/>I&apos;m Brainman&apos;s COO.</p>
<p begin="00:18:00:360" end="00:18:01:840">Feel free to tell me what you need.</p>
<p begin="00:18:01:960" end="00:18:02:920">Thank you.</p>
<p begin="00:18:03:000" end="00:18:04:840">Two people to a team.<br/>Start collecting the evidence.</p>
<p begin="00:18:04:960" end="00:18:06:000">Yes, Madam.</p>
<p begin="00:18:06:040" end="00:18:07:200">This way.</p>
<p begin="00:18:08:000" end="00:18:11:520">Brother Yung, shall we talk?</p>
<p begin="00:18:14:960" end="00:18:16:560">Get someone to open the cabinet for me.</p>
<p begin="00:18:16:680" end="00:18:18:800">Excuse me. I need to take away<br/>your computer for the investigation.</p>
<p begin="00:18:21:760" end="00:18:23:880">Be careful. My handbag costs over $100,000.</p>
<p begin="00:18:24:040" end="00:18:25:720">Please don&apos;t obstruct police work.</p>
<p begin="00:18:25:800" end="00:18:27:880">If you care about so much,<br/>you can take it away.</p>
<p begin="00:18:29:320" end="00:18:31:240">You don&apos;t have the key because<br/>Wong Shiu-lun hasn&apos;t come to work?</p>
<p begin="00:18:31:400" end="00:18:32:480">Don&apos;t lie to me.</p>
<p begin="00:18:32:720" end="00:18:34:360">Ask someone from Engineering to pry it open.</p>
<p begin="00:18:34:480" end="00:18:37:760">I&apos;m here to work. Say what you want to say.</p>
<p begin="00:18:40:040" end="00:18:42:320">You know I&apos;ve treated you like<br/>my older brother all along.</p>
<p begin="00:18:42:440" end="00:18:45:080">We haven&apos;t seen each other in so long.<br/>I just wanted to say hello. How are you?</p>
<p begin="00:18:45:120" end="00:18:49:080">Fine. I can eat and sleep well.</p>
<p begin="00:18:49:280" end="00:18:51:920">Maybe it&apos;s because I haven&apos;t done<br/>anything against my conscience.</p>
<p begin="00:18:52:000" end="00:18:56:320">I recently applied for a transfer to CCB,<br/>Commercial Crime Bureau.</p>
<p begin="00:18:56:440" end="00:18:58:680">You may not want to see me again.</p>
<p begin="00:19:00:840" end="00:19:01:600">Brother Yung.</p>
<p begin="00:19:01:680" end="00:19:04:880">Don&apos;t call me that. Call me Chow Sir.</p>
<p begin="00:19:05:240" end="00:19:08:760">We live in the same place,<br/>but we belong to two different worlds.</p>
<p begin="00:19:08:840" end="00:19:11:760">Believe it or not, I&apos;m innocent this time.</p>
<p begin="00:19:11:840" end="00:19:15:400">Come on. When did you<br/>ever say otherwise?</p>
<p begin="00:19:15:600" end="00:19:19:240">Can you be more objective about me?<br/>I know I was negligent before.</p>
<p begin="00:19:19:360" end="00:19:21:080">But Lai&apos;s death was an accident.<br/>No one wanted that to happen.</p>
<p begin="00:19:21:160" end="00:19:22:680">You have no right to talk about<br/>my younger sister in front of me.</p>
<p begin="00:19:22:760" end="00:19:23:720">I loved Lai more than you did.</p>
<p begin="00:19:23:760" end="00:19:25:000">That&apos;s enough.</p>
<p begin="00:19:25:680" end="00:19:29:520">I bet you remember this gold coin.<br/>You and Lai gave it to me as a gift.</p>
<p begin="00:19:29:680" end="00:19:32:120">The two of us are the people<br/>Lai loved the most.</p>
<p begin="00:19:32:280" end="00:19:34:440">I believe she wouldn&apos;t want to<br/>see our relationship like this.</p>
<p begin="00:19:34:520" end="00:19:35:800">You think I&apos;m picking on you just because</p>
<p begin="00:19:35:920" end="00:19:40:240">you got my younger sister killed<br/>in the accident? No.</p>
<p begin="00:19:40:400" end="00:19:42:440">It&apos;s because you&apos;ve done<br/>too many illegal things.</p>
<p begin="00:19:42:520" end="00:19:43:520">That&apos;s the way it works<br/>in the financial world.</p>
<p begin="00:19:43:600" end="00:19:44:920">You must accept defeat<br/>if you play this game.</p>
<p begin="00:19:45:000" end="00:19:46:480">I can defeat them because they&apos;re not<br/>as good as I am.</p>
<p begin="00:19:46:520" end="00:19:48:520">If you played fair, I wouldn&apos;t criticize you</p>
<p begin="00:19:48:640" end="00:19:51:320">But if someone manipulates the market,<br/>falsifies accounts</p>
<p begin="00:19:51:400" end="00:19:56:800">and engages in insider dealings,<br/>then he&apos;s cheating. He&apos;s a robber.</p>
<p begin="00:19:59:840" end="00:20:00:840">Excuse me, Mr Cheuk.</p>
<p begin="00:20:00:920" end="00:20:02:840">We need to take away<br/>your computer for the investigation.</p>
<p begin="00:20:05:040" end="00:20:10:360">Cheuk Yuk, you won&apos;t be lucky enough<br/>to get away every time. Remember that.</p>
<p begin="00:20:29:440" end="00:20:31:480">Ella, take this computer too.</p>
<p begin="00:20:31:560" end="00:20:32:680">Yes, Madam.</p>
<p begin="00:20:39:440" end="00:20:41:040">OK. I&apos;m fine.</p>
<p begin="00:20:42:120" end="00:20:44:840">Hey, the officers are coming.</p>
<p begin="00:20:44:920" end="00:20:47:240">I&apos;m sorry. We&apos;re still investigating<br/>this case. No comment.</p>
<p begin="00:20:47:320" end="00:20:51:160">Sir, tell us more...Sir...</p>
<p begin="00:20:51:240" end="00:20:53:840">Mr Cheuk.</p>
<p begin="00:20:56:240" end="00:20:58:280">Mr Cheuk, Brainman Group<br/>is under investigation.</p>
<p begin="00:20:58:400" end="00:21:00:880">Is this related to Engola buying out<br/>Big Light Year earlier?</p>
<p begin="00:21:01:040" end="00:21:03:320">Word is that Big Light Year&apos;s<br/>subsidiary company Little Comet</p>
<p begin="00:21:03:440" end="00:21:06:040">has some serious problems.<br/>Is that true? Please tell us.</p>
<p begin="00:21:06:120" end="00:21:08:480">Brainman Group did its very best<br/>in that buyout</p>
<p begin="00:21:08:640" end="00:21:10:680">to safeguard the interest<br/>of both parties.</p>
<p begin="00:21:10:800" end="00:21:14:360">I&apos;m sorry that Engola is troubled by<br/>the indebtedness of Little Comet.</p>
<p begin="00:21:14:480" end="00:21:17:520">Brainman Group is Engola&apos;s investment bank.<br/>Is it responsible for this?</p>
<p begin="00:21:17:640" end="00:21:19:600">We will do whatever we can<br/>to accommodate CCB&apos;s investigation.</p>
<p begin="00:21:19:720" end="00:21:23:640">But it&apos;s premature to say at this stage<br/>whether we&apos;re responsible for this.</p>
<p begin="00:21:23:720" end="00:21:26:240">As the saying goes, what&apos;s true<br/>won&apos;t become false</p>
<p begin="00:21:26:400" end="00:21:27:400">and what&apos;s false won&apos;t become true.</p>
<p begin="00:21:28:520" end="00:21:29:880">Hey, what are you looking at?</p>
<p begin="00:21:30:640" end="00:21:31:880">Mr Cheuk, are you worried</p>
<p begin="00:21:31:960" end="00:21:34:240">CCB&apos;s investigation might affect<br/>Brainman&apos;s stock price?</p>
<p begin="00:21:34:320" end="00:21:38:560">Oh, this reporter is very smart.<br/>He&apos;s my friend. I can introduce him to you.</p>
<p begin="00:21:40:280" end="00:21:43:400">Hong Kong has a well-managed<br/>financial market.</p>
<p begin="00:21:43:480" end="00:21:46:480">There&apos;ll never be a situation where<br/>bad money drives out good.</p>
<p begin="00:21:46:600" end="00:21:51:200">A healthy and law-abiding company<br/>won&apos;t be hurt by rumors.</p>
<p begin="00:21:51:320" end="00:21:53:680">I have great confidence in Brainman.</p>
<p begin="00:22:20:400" end="00:22:25:040">OK. It&apos;s going to be tough. Come on.</p>
<p begin="00:22:26:720" end="00:22:28:480">Madam Pushy&apos;s pressing us hard again.</p>
<p begin="00:22:28:680" end="00:22:30:520">There are so many documents.</p>
<p begin="00:22:30:600" end="00:22:32:560">We don&apos;t know when we&apos;ll<br/>finish reading them.</p>
<p begin="00:22:32:680" end="00:22:35:440">That&apos;s the way CCB works.<br/>You&apos;re still not used to it?</p>
<p begin="00:22:35:520" end="00:22:38:520">Mentor, given your experience,<br/>how can we expedite this?</p>
<p begin="00:22:38:560" end="00:22:42:240">CCB is different from other departments<br/>in the police force.</p>
<p begin="00:22:42:360" end="00:22:44:640">We need to outwit the criminals.</p>
<p begin="00:22:44:720" end="00:22:46:600">We also need to deal with<br/>piles of documents.</p>
<p begin="00:22:46:680" end="00:22:48:160">Our adversaries are computers.</p>
<p begin="00:22:48:240" end="00:22:51:200">The documents and computers<br/>won&apos;t respond to us.</p>
<p begin="00:22:51:360" end="00:22:54:760">You can&apos;t bluff them or question them.</p>
<p begin="00:22:54:920" end="00:22:58:480">You can only read each and<br/>every file in great detail.</p>
<p begin="00:22:58:600" end="00:23:00:360">The devil is in the details.</p>
<p begin="00:23:00:440" end="00:23:03:600">So we can&apos;t be slack or we&apos;ll miss things.</p>
<p begin="00:23:03:680" end="00:23:06:320">Actually there&apos;ve been cases similar to<br/>Big Light Year&apos;s case before.</p>
<p begin="00:23:06:440" end="00:23:11:280">There was the Cheung Luen case in 2009,<br/>the Kai Kei incident two years ago</p>
<p begin="00:23:11:400" end="00:23:13:320">resulting in Kai Kei writing off $2 billion.</p>
<p begin="00:23:13:400" end="00:23:14:680">The M.O. is more or less the same.</p>
<p begin="00:23:14:800" end="00:23:17:640">You guys can use those cases<br/>as references to break this case.</p>
<p begin="00:23:18:120" end="00:23:20:240">Chi Nga, you&apos;ve been with CCB for 6 months.</p>
<p begin="00:23:20:320" end="00:23:22:000">You&apos;ve already been following cases<br/>thoroughly. You&apos;re real smart.</p>
<p begin="00:23:22:120" end="00:23:23:240">Keep up the good work.</p>
<p begin="00:23:23:280" end="00:23:24:280">OK.</p>
<p begin="00:23:24:360" end="00:23:25:040">Get back to work.</p>
<p begin="00:23:25:080" end="00:23:26:520">Yes, Mentor.</p>
<p begin="00:23:27:040" end="00:23:30:880">Mentor, just now I noticed that<br/>you seem to know Cheuk Yuk.</p>
<p begin="00:23:30:920" end="00:23:32:600">Do I? No, I don&apos;t.</p>
<p begin="00:23:56:360" end="00:23:59:280">When does your team&apos;s shift usually end?</p>
<p begin="00:24:02:600" end="00:24:03:520">Follow me.</p>
<p begin="00:24:05:200" end="00:24:09:520">Don&apos;t look at me.<br/>I won&apos;t ask her or I&apos;ll get scolded.</p>
<p begin="00:24:12:320" end="00:24:15:200">But you&apos;re Madam Pushy&apos;s boyfriend.</p>
<p begin="00:24:15:280" end="00:24:17:680">Ask Sheung-fei to talk to her.<br/>She&apos;s Madam Pushy&apos;s younger sister.</p>
<p begin="00:24:17:720" end="00:24:18:600">Sheung-fei.</p>
<p begin="00:24:18:680" end="00:24:23:440">Don&apos;t look at me. I have no say<br/>in the office or at home.</p>
<p begin="00:24:23:520" end="00:24:24:320">Chi Nga.</p>
<p begin="00:24:24:400" end="00:24:27:560">We all remember what Mentor told us<br/>the first day we joined CCB, right?</p>
<p begin="00:24:27:640" end="00:24:28:440">Who are we?</p>
<p begin="00:24:28:520" end="00:24:32:040">CC Buddy, one heart one mind.</p>
<p begin="00:24:32:080" end="00:24:33:720">Come on, Mentor. You do it.</p>
<p begin="00:24:33:760" end="00:24:35:080">How&apos;s it going?<br/>Madam.</p>
<p begin="00:24:35:160" end="00:24:37:080">You guys want to go home?</p>
<p begin="00:24:37:160" end="00:24:38:320">No...</p>
<p begin="00:24:38:360" end="00:24:42:520">No. We&apos;ve been sitting for hours.<br/>So we just wanted to exercise a bit.</p>
<p begin="00:24:42:600" end="00:24:43:640">Let&apos;s get back to work.</p>
<p begin="00:24:43:720" end="00:24:46:240">I wanted to tell you guys that<br/>you can go home now.</p>
<p begin="00:24:46:280" end="00:24:47:080">Thank you, Madam.</p>
<p begin="00:24:47:160" end="00:24:47:720">Oh, thank you.</p>
<p begin="00:24:47:760" end="00:24:49:720">Thank you, Madam...</p>
<p begin="00:24:50:840" end="00:24:51:800">Why are you so nice today?</p>
<p begin="00:24:51:880" end="00:24:53:000">There&apos;s something going on at home.</p>
<p begin="00:24:55:880" end="00:24:57:560">Yung, I knew you were coming for dinner.</p>
<p begin="00:24:57:640" end="00:24:59:880">I cooked steamed pork with<br/>salted eggs especially for you.</p>
<p begin="00:24:59:960" end="00:25:01:880">You&apos;re really so good to me, Auntie.</p>
<p begin="00:25:01:920" end="00:25:03:680">It&apos;s OK as long as you&apos;re good<br/>to my Sheung-yee.</p>
<p begin="00:25:03:720" end="00:25:05:440">Of course...I&apos;m really good to her.</p>
<p begin="00:25:05:480" end="00:25:08:520">Look. This is new. Is it cool?</p>
<p begin="00:25:08:920" end="00:25:10:600">Honey, you&apos;re so handsome.</p>
<p begin="00:25:10:720" end="00:25:12:720">Stop trying on clothes. Sit down and eat.</p>
<p begin="00:25:12:800" end="00:25:13:240">OK.</p>
<p begin="00:25:13:280" end="00:25:13:800">Let me help you take it off.</p>
<p begin="00:25:13:880" end="00:25:14:440">Thank you.</p>
<p begin="00:25:14:480" end="00:25:16:920">How come you don&apos;t need to<br/>work in the restaurant?</p>
<p begin="00:25:16:960" end="00:25:20:520">Sis Yee, have you forgotten<br/>what I told you earlier?</p>
<p begin="00:25:20:600" end="00:25:22:120">I said I&apos;d quit my job in the restaurant.</p>
<p begin="00:25:22:160" end="00:25:24:320">I&apos;m setting up a cafe in Changping<br/>with my friends.</p>
<p begin="00:25:24:400" end="00:25:27:400">Hong Kong style cafes are the trend now.<br/>Business will be good for sure.</p>
<p begin="00:25:27:480" end="00:25:31:280">So I bought a presentable suit<br/>for when I talk to the big bosses.</p>
<p begin="00:25:31:400" end="00:25:34:480">That&apos;s true.People assess you by what you <br/>wear.</p>
<p begin="00:25:34:560" end="00:25:37:160">Honey, what you say is so true.</p>
<p begin="00:25:37:240" end="00:25:41:080">Sis Yee, you haven&apos;t been home<br/>for dinner in a long time.</p>
<p begin="00:25:41:160" end="00:25:42:480">Let me get you a drumstick.</p>
<p begin="00:25:42:560" end="00:25:45:440">That&apos;s not how you run a business.<br/>You better re-consider.</p>
<p begin="00:25:45:480" end="00:25:47:680">It&apos;s different this time.<br/>I&apos;m doing something I&apos;m good at.</p>
<p begin="00:25:47:760" end="00:25:49:240">I was a cook of Western food before.</p>
<p begin="00:25:49:320" end="00:25:52:720">He quit because he found it too tough.</p>
<p begin="00:25:52:880" end="00:25:55:880">Now I&apos;m a managing the restaurant.</p>
<p begin="00:25:55:960" end="00:25:58:360">He&apos;s just a junior manager.</p>
<p begin="00:25:58:440" end="00:26:01:800">I met the big bosses in the restaurant.</p>
<p begin="00:26:01:880" end="00:26:07:080">They&apos;re giving me a chance now.<br/>I must grab it. I&apos;ll set up more branches.</p>
<p begin="00:26:07:160" end="00:26:10:560">Then I&apos;ll get the company listed.<br/>I&apos;ll be rich then.</p>
<p begin="00:26:10:640" end="00:26:14:400">That&apos;s true.<br/>I hope Hing can get rich soon.</p>
<p begin="00:26:14:480" end="00:26:19:560">Sis Yee, I&apos;ve got everything except capital.<br/>Have you made a decision?</p>
<p begin="00:26:19:640" end="00:26:20:840">I read your proposal.</p>
<p begin="00:26:20:960" end="00:26:22:880">I also sent someone to Changping<br/>to do a site inspection.</p>
<p begin="00:26:22:960" end="00:26:25:360">You asked someone to check on me?<br/>You&apos;re treating me like an offender?</p>
<p begin="00:26:25:480" end="00:26:28:440">The location of the mall is poor.<br/>There isn&apos;t a good flow of people.</p>
<p begin="00:26:28:560" end="00:26:31:520">Even if you can set up a cafe there,<br/>you still won&apos;t get any business.</p>
<p begin="00:26:31:600" end="00:26:33:640">Changping is just to testing the waters.</p>
<p begin="00:26:33:760" end="00:26:35:000">If you think the flow of people</p>
<p begin="00:26:35:120" end="00:26:36:600">and the ancillary transport<br/>facilities there aren&apos;t good,</p>
<p begin="00:26:36:680" end="00:26:41:560">I don&apos;t mind building my new career<br/>in Beijing and Shanghai.</p>
<p begin="00:26:41:640" end="00:26:44:640">Do you know the rent in China<br/>is as high as Hong Kong&apos;s?</p>
<p begin="00:26:44:760" end="00:26:46:040">How can you run a business like this?</p>
<p begin="00:26:46:120" end="00:26:48:280">If you think like this,<br/>I won&apos;t lend you any money.</p>
<p begin="00:26:48:320" end="00:26:49:280">She&apos;s going to lose it.</p>
<p begin="00:26:49:360" end="00:26:50:000">You keep criticizing me.</p>
<p begin="00:26:50:040" end="00:26:51:680">Then mom shouldn&apos;t pressure me<br/>to have a kid.</p>
<p begin="00:26:51:800" end="00:26:55:320">I don&apos;t want to be an employee<br/>when my son&apos;s born.</p>
<p begin="00:26:55:440" end="00:26:58:080">That&apos;s true. You must have a kid<br/>while you&apos;re still young.</p>
<p begin="00:26:58:160" end="00:27:01:040">It&apos;ll be tough for Man to be an old mother.</p>
<p begin="00:27:01:120" end="00:27:05:360">Yee, see if you can help<br/>your younger brother.</p>
<p begin="00:27:05:440" end="00:27:07:640">Mom, you&apos;ll only spoil him.</p>
<p begin="00:27:07:720" end="00:27:10:960">Fine if you don&apos;t want to help me.<br/>Don&apos;t criticize me.</p>
<p begin="00:27:11:040" end="00:27:13:560">When did I criticize you?<br/>I&apos;m teaching you.</p>
<p begin="00:27:13:640" end="00:27:15:360">What kind of attitude is this?</p>
<p begin="00:27:15:440" end="00:27:16:360">Yung, you&apos;re choking?</p>
<p begin="00:27:16:440" end="00:27:17:120">Mentor, are you OK?</p>
<p begin="00:27:17:200" end="00:27:17:960">Brother Yung, are you OK?</p>
<p begin="00:27:18:000" end="00:27:19:200">How are you? What&apos;s the matter?<br/>Shall I get you some water?</p>
<p begin="00:27:21:160" end="00:27:26:080">I&apos;m fine. You guys care about<br/>each other so much.</p>
<p begin="00:27:26:160" end="00:27:29:320">I&apos;m just so moved. I&apos;m fine. Eat.</p>
<p begin="00:27:29:400" end="00:27:29:880">Eat...</p>
<p begin="00:27:29:960" end="00:27:31:880">There are plenty of opportunities.</p>
<p begin="00:27:32:000" end="00:27:34:760">Just take your time to talk<br/>and think about it, OK?</p>
<p begin="00:27:34:880" end="00:27:35:840">Eat the pork.</p>
<p begin="00:27:35:920" end="00:27:39:720">Thank you. What matters is that the<br/>family is happy. Eat.</p>
<p begin="00:27:43:920" end="00:27:44:520">What&apos;s the matter?</p>
<p begin="00:27:44:600" end="00:27:45:320">You&apos;re pretending again?</p>
<p begin="00:27:45:440" end="00:27:46:360">We&apos;re fine. Cut it out.</p>
<p begin="00:27:46:440" end="00:27:47:800">He&apos;s not pretending. He&apos;s really choking.</p>
<p begin="00:27:47:880" end="00:27:48:680">You&apos;re really choking?</p>
<p begin="00:27:48:720" end="00:27:49:920">Have some soup.</p>
<p begin="00:27:50:000" end="00:27:53:600">I told you not to pretend all the time.<br/>Now you&apos;re in trouble.</p>
<p begin="00:27:57:080" end="00:27:58:640">I&apos;m OK.</p>
<p begin="00:27:58:760" end="00:28:00:320">I told you to be serious.</p>
<p begin="00:28:06:280" end="00:28:08:560">Are you out of your mind?<br/>We live on the fourth floor.</p>
<p begin="00:28:08:720" end="00:28:11:560">There&apos;s a surprise on the eighth floor.</p>
<p begin="00:28:15:880" end="00:28:17:320">What are you doing?</p>
<p begin="00:28:20:600" end="00:28:22:520">Get a chair.</p>
<p begin="00:28:22:560" end="00:28:24:120">This place?</p>
<p begin="00:28:24:680" end="00:28:27:080">You always say you like<br/>the layout of this building.</p>
<p begin="00:28:27:240" end="00:28:29:200">It&apos;s convenient to get to work from here.</p>
<p begin="00:28:29:280" end="00:28:31:400">So I&apos;m always checking to see<br/>if anyone&apos;s selling.</p>
<p begin="00:28:31:480" end="00:28:33:400">You bought the flat?</p>
<p begin="00:28:34:760" end="00:28:38:240">The interest rate is low.<br/>Buying a flat is better than renting one.</p>
<p begin="00:28:38:320" end="00:28:41:880">Clever. This is a hedge against inflation.</p>
<p begin="00:28:42:000" end="00:28:48:320">More than that.<br/>It gives me a reason to find a partner.</p>
<p begin="00:28:48:360" end="00:28:50:800">I know you want to get married.</p>
<p begin="00:28:50:880" end="00:28:56:120">I&apos;m old. As your mom said,<br/>I have to have a kid while I&apos;m still young.</p>
<p begin="00:28:56:200" end="00:29:00:720">I don&apos;t want to go to my son&apos;s<br/>primary school graduation when I&apos;m 70.</p>
<p begin="00:29:00:800" end="00:29:03:280">Too bad my younger brother<br/>hasn&apos;t grown up yet.</p>
<p begin="00:29:03:360" end="00:29:05:480">Every family has a black sheep.</p>
<p begin="00:29:05:520" end="00:29:11:000">He&apos;s a grown-up now. He&apos;s even married.<br/>You should let his wife deal with him.</p>
<p begin="00:29:11:080" end="00:29:13:640">Too bad she listens to everything he says.</p>
<p begin="00:29:13:720" end="00:29:16:760">Whenever something happens,<br/>she&apos;ll ask me to talk to her husband.</p>
<p begin="00:29:16:840" end="00:29:18:040">Mom&apos;s even worse.</p>
<p begin="00:29:18:080" end="00:29:19:000">Whenever my younger brother<br/>gets in trouble,</p>
<p begin="00:29:19:080" end="00:29:20:440">she&apos;ll ask me to help him.</p>
<p begin="00:29:20:520" end="00:29:23:600">I understand. What about our future?<br/>Don&apos;t you need to consider that?</p>
<p begin="00:29:23:680" end="00:29:26:480">I have considered that.<br/>I don&apos;t just care about my family.</p>
<p begin="00:29:26:520" end="00:29:28:720">That&apos;s why I&apos;ve enrolled in a<br/>one-year course.</p>
<p begin="00:29:28:800" end="00:29:31:400">When I&apos;ve completed that,<br/>I&apos;ll have a chance for a promotion.</p>
<p begin="00:29:31:440" end="00:29:34:520">You keep studying and taking exams<br/>these past couple of years.</p>
<p begin="00:29:34:600" end="00:29:35:800">You&apos;ve jumped several grades already.</p>
<p begin="00:29:35:880" end="00:29:37:680">You want a promotion again<br/>in such a short time?</p>
<p begin="00:29:37:760" end="00:29:39:560">We&apos;ve only been seeing each other<br/>for three years.</p>
<p begin="00:29:39:640" end="00:29:42:560">That&apos;s already so long.<br/>Flash marriages are the trend now.</p>
<p begin="00:29:43:120" end="00:29:47:800">Did I hear you correctly?<br/>Mentor, I didn&apos;t realize you&apos;re so in?</p>
<p begin="00:29:47:840" end="00:29:49:840">Are you belittling me?</p>
<p begin="00:29:49:920" end="00:29:55:480">No, I deeply appreciate you.<br/>I find you so handsome and nice.</p>
<p begin="00:29:55:520" end="00:29:58:120">You&apos;re very good to me.<br/>You&apos;re a 100 percent good man.</p>
<p begin="00:29:58:160" end="00:30:00:000">Tell me. Will you marry me?</p>
<p begin="00:30:00:040" end="00:30:05:480">Later. Let me think about it first, OK?<br/>Be good...</p>
<p begin="00:30:05:560" end="00:30:15:280">OK. Got it. I&apos;ve bought a flat already.<br/>But this is your answer. My heart is broken.</p>
<p begin="00:30:16:960" end="00:30:18:840">How do you want me to make it up to you?</p>
<p begin="00:30:20:800" end="00:30:22:400">Let&apos;s try the new bed.</p>
<p begin="00:30:25:360" end="00:30:26:920">Hang Seng Index soared on Monday.</p>
<p begin="00:30:27:080" end="00:30:29:320">Yesterday there was still support<br/>from investors.</p>
<p begin="00:30:29:480" end="00:30:30:960">It went up another 269 points...</p>
<p begin="00:30:31:040" end="00:30:31:920">What would you like to eat?</p>
<p begin="00:30:32:000" end="00:30:33:080">Set A with yin yang (coffee mixed<br/>with tea) please.</p>
<p begin="00:30:33:200" end="00:30:37:400">Set A with yin yang.<br/>OK. Set A with yin yang.</p>
<p begin="00:30:37:440" end="00:30:38:640">OK.</p>
<p begin="00:30:39:320" end="00:30:41:040">Coffee, tea.</p>
<p begin="00:30:41:120" end="00:30:42:120">Thank you.</p>
<p begin="00:30:42:160" end="00:30:43:000">No problem.</p>
<p begin="00:30:43:240" end="00:30:45:640">Yesterday we went to Brainman<br/>in such a high profile way.</p>
<p begin="00:30:45:760" end="00:30:47:800">The news is at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p begin="00:30:47:880" end="00:30:50:240">It&apos;s smaller than the<br/>anti-prostitution operation.</p>
<p begin="00:30:50:920" end="00:30:56:200">Never mind.Today only old men buy newspap<br/>ers.</p>
<p begin="00:30:57:320" end="00:31:01:200">This morning we have Brainman Group&apos;s<br/>chief analyst M. Tsui Kam-fat</p>
<p begin="00:31:01:320" end="00:31:02:400">to talk to us about stocks.</p>
<p begin="00:31:02:520" end="00:31:05:040">Master Fat, how&apos;s the market this morning?</p>
<p begin="00:31:05:200" end="00:31:07:240">The market has gone up for a couple of days.</p>
<p begin="00:31:07:280" end="00:31:10:720">It needs to take a break.</p>
<p begin="00:31:10:880" end="00:31:12:120">Rumor has it the big players<br/>want to do two things.</p>
<p begin="00:31:12:200" end="00:31:13:800">Egg-tart.           Thank you.</p>
<p begin="00:31:14:560" end="00:31:17:160">First, they&apos;ll boost the market to sell.</p>
<p begin="00:31:17:280" end="00:31:22:680">If the index falls below 27,100 points,<br/>we must leave the market right away.</p>
<p begin="00:31:22:800" end="00:31:24:800">Secondly, they&apos;ll prepare to strike.</p>
<p begin="00:31:24:960" end="00:31:29:440">Today the market will fluctuate between<br/>22,500and 22,600 points.</p>
<p begin="00:31:29:560" end="00:31:34:680">But we must wait for the US data<br/>to be released next week.</p>
<p begin="00:31:34:840" end="00:31:37:040">That&apos;s because the big players<br/>could change their mind anytime.</p>
<p begin="00:31:37:160" end="00:31:41:800">We still need to watch.<br/>Anyway, the market is unstable now.</p>
<p begin="00:31:41:960" end="00:31:46:960">So don&apos;t put all your money in.<br/>Be careful, you may suffer a loss.</p>
<p begin="00:31:47:120" end="00:31:49:120">Someone has just phoned in.<br/>You can talk to her first.</p>
<p begin="00:31:49:200" end="00:31:49:960">OK.</p>
<p begin="00:31:50:040" end="00:31:51:200">It&apos;s Madam Chu.</p>
<p begin="00:31:51:240" end="00:31:53:760">No, I&apos;m Miss Chu...<br/>I&apos;m Miss Chu. Is it my turn?</p>
<p begin="00:31:53:840" end="00:31:56:520">Good morning, Miss Chu.<br/>What can I do for you?</p>
<p begin="00:31:56:640" end="00:32:02:240">Hello. I bought some Big Light Year<br/>shares earlier at $2/share.</p>
<p begin="00:32:02:360" end="00:32:04:680">But today I read in the newspaper<br/>that it&apos;s in trouble.</p>
<p begin="00:32:04:760" end="00:32:06:400">Brainman is under investigation too.</p>
<p begin="00:32:06:520" end="00:32:08:280">I want to know if I should<br/>hold the shares</p>
<p begin="00:32:08:360" end="00:32:09:960">or sell them to cut loss and take profit.</p>
<p begin="00:32:10:040" end="00:32:12:400">Miss Chu, I must clarify something.</p>
<p begin="00:32:12:480" end="00:32:15:800">Brainman Group is only assisting the police<br/>in the investigation.</p>
<p begin="00:32:15:880" end="00:32:17:120">It doesn&apos;t have a problem.</p>
<p begin="00:32:17:240" end="00:32:21:360">Also, I&apos;m an analyst at Brainman.<br/>So I can&apos;t talk about our shares.</p>
<p begin="00:32:21:480" end="00:32:26:600">As for whether you should keep<br/>Big Light Year&apos;s shares,</p>
<p begin="00:32:26:680" end="00:32:30:280">I think we need to view it from the<br/>perspective of China&apos;s infrastructure.</p>
<p begin="00:32:30:400" end="00:32:32:840">The stock market<br/>can go either up or down.</p>
<p begin="00:32:32:920" end="00:32:36:040">You must be moderate<br/>even if you want to be aggressive.</p>
<p begin="00:32:36:160" end="00:32:40:200">He&apos;s not answering the question.<br/>But so many people still listen to him.</p>
<p begin="00:32:40:280" end="00:32:42:040">Thank you very much, Master Fat.</p>
<p begin="00:32:42:160" end="00:32:44:920">Why does Sis Shim believes that analyst?</p>
<p begin="00:32:45:000" end="00:32:48:520">Trust Master Fat and you&apos;ll know<br/>what shares to buy. Thank you for calling.</p>
<p begin="00:32:48:640" end="00:32:50:320">Bye...</p>
<p begin="00:32:53:360" end="00:32:56:600">Brother Yung, is the tea OK?</p>
<p begin="00:32:56:800" end="00:32:59:320">I don&apos;t think you care about the tea.</p>
<p begin="00:32:59:440" end="00:33:04:040">You&apos;re so smart. You can always<br/>read a woman&apos;s mind.</p>
<p begin="00:33:04:160" end="00:33:07:200">The news report said you guys<br/>went to Brainman to arrest people.</p>
<p begin="00:33:07:280" end="00:33:10:120">Did that company break the law?<br/>Shall I sell all their shares?</p>
<p begin="00:33:10:200" end="00:33:14:480">Miss Chu Kiu-shim, the police can&apos;t<br/>disclose details. I&apos;m sorry.</p>
<p begin="00:33:14:640" end="00:33:16:480">What does it matter to you,<br/>Chu Kwok-leung?</p>
<p begin="00:33:16:560" end="00:33:18:960">Hey, Brother Yung, you don&apos;t need to talk.</p>
<p begin="00:33:19:040" end="00:33:21:440">Just use your facial expression<br/>or hand gesture to tell me.</p>
<p begin="00:33:21:480" end="00:33:23:040">Mentor, we should go.<br/>OK.</p>
<p begin="00:33:23:160" end="00:33:24:520">Hey, put it on my account.</p>
<p begin="00:33:25:160" end="00:33:26:120">Excuse me.</p>
<p begin="00:33:26:360" end="00:33:27:680">Your older sister is cute.</p>
<p begin="00:33:27:760" end="00:33:29:960">Are you interested in her?<br/>I need a brother-in-law.</p>
<p begin="00:33:30:520" end="00:33:32:440">Lots of clients called to ask about<br/>the company&apos;s situation.</p>
<p begin="00:33:32:560" end="00:33:33:560">So did my clients.</p>
<p begin="00:33:33:680" end="00:33:36:680">They&apos;re afraid the Big Light Year case<br/>will affect the yield of their investment.</p>
<p begin="00:33:36:840" end="00:33:39:480">Most important of all,<br/>our share price is under pressure.</p>
<p begin="00:33:39:600" end="00:33:41:320">The investigation is just a formality.</p>
<p begin="00:33:41:440" end="00:33:43:040">We&apos;ll be fine<br/>when the investigation&apos;s over.</p>
<p begin="00:33:43:080" end="00:33:46:000">Master Fat, say something.</p>
<p begin="00:33:46:120" end="00:33:49:120">I think if we have problems,<br/>we should solve them.</p>
<p begin="00:33:49:200" end="00:33:51:760">We can make it less serious<br/>and turn it into a winning scenario.</p>
<p begin="00:33:51:840" end="00:33:54:120">Turn the crisis into an opportunity.</p>
<p begin="00:33:54:880" end="00:33:58:320">Good. Why are you guys reacting this way?</p>
<p begin="00:33:58:480" end="00:34:01:320">I think Master Fat&apos;s got a good mindset.</p>
<p begin="00:34:01:440" end="00:34:04:320">He doesn&apos;t bring in problems<br/>without a solution.</p>
<p begin="00:34:04:440" end="00:34:09:920">How do I-bankers survive?<br/>We solve any and all problems.</p>
<p begin="00:34:10:080" end="00:34:14:480">Only we can make a profit whether<br/>the market goes up or down.</p>
<p begin="00:34:14:600" end="00:34:16:320">Do I need to teach you that?</p>
<p begin="00:34:16:440" end="00:34:17:880">You guys know what to do.</p>
<p begin="00:34:26:320" end="00:34:28:720">Mr Sin, how is your<br/>Sin Man Keung Accountants</p>
<p begin="00:34:28:840" end="00:34:31:240">affected by the Big Light Year case?</p>
<p begin="00:34:31:360" end="00:34:34:440">Actually it&apos;s the professional misconduct<br/>of a hired auditor.</p>
<p begin="00:34:34:520" end="00:34:36:880">It has nothing to do with the partners<br/>of the accounting firm.</p>
<p begin="00:34:37:000" end="00:34:39:960">The Institute of<br/>Certified Public Accountants will follow up.</p>
<p begin="00:34:40:040" end="00:34:44:440">I know very well your worries, Chairlady.<br/>I sit in so many public offices.</p>
<p begin="00:34:44:520" end="00:34:49:080">I&apos;m even the vice-chairman of SMAC.<br/>I should be a good role model.</p>
<p begin="00:34:49:200" end="00:34:54:080">But suddenly there&apos;s a scandal<br/>in my accounting firm now. I&apos;m so sorry.</p>
<p begin="00:34:54:160" end="00:34:56:040">No one wanted this to happen.</p>
<p begin="00:34:56:120" end="00:35:02:000">CCB is also checking another member,<br/>Cheuk Yuk. What&apos;s his situation?</p>
<p begin="00:35:02:080" end="00:35:05:240">I heard his employee Wong Shiu-lung<br/>wants to turn prosecution witness.</p>
<p begin="00:35:05:320" end="00:35:11:840">He&apos;s suddenly accused Cheuk Yuk<br/>as the mastermind. It&apos;s really complicated.</p>
<p begin="00:35:11:960" end="00:35:13:240">I don&apos;t know who&apos;s guilty.</p>
<p begin="00:35:13:280" end="00:35:15:720">Cheuk Yuk has risen so quickly in the<br/>financial sector these past couple of years.</p>
<p begin="00:35:15:800" end="00:35:16:920">He has a bright future.</p>
<p begin="00:35:17:040" end="00:35:19:920">I don&apos;t think he would be so stupid<br/>to get greedy like this.</p>
<p begin="00:35:20:000" end="00:35:22:760">When a person gets greedy...</p>
<p begin="00:35:23:800" end="00:35:28:120">Of course I don&apos;t want any<br/>committee members to get into trouble.</p>
<p begin="00:35:28:200" end="00:35:29:240">Neither do I.</p>
<p begin="00:35:29:320" end="00:35:31:600">But if I find out that someone<br/>has done something wrong,</p>
<p begin="00:35:31:640" end="00:35:33:480">I will deal with it impartially.</p>
<p begin="00:35:33:600" end="00:35:37:160">I have a duty to make sure<br/>the financial market is fair, just and open.</p>
<p begin="00:35:37:280" end="00:35:40:040">I must protect our reputation<br/>as an international financial center.</p>
<p begin="00:35:50:040" end="00:35:53:920">Pass him...</p>
<p begin="00:35:53:960" end="00:35:55:800">Come on...</p>
<p begin="00:36:09:880" end="00:36:10:880">Brother Yung, please have some tea.</p>
<p begin="00:36:11:080" end="00:36:13:240">Thank you. Come on. Sit down...</p>
<p begin="00:36:15:240" end="00:36:17:520">I know you want to set up<br/>an investment company with Shing.</p>
<p begin="00:36:17:560" end="00:36:20:000">Come on. Take the money.</p>
<p begin="00:36:21:080" end="00:36:22:360">No, this is a huge sum.</p>
<p begin="00:36:22:440" end="00:36:25:000">Both of you are my good friends.<br/>You&apos;re even my brother-in-law.</p>
<p begin="00:36:25:120" end="00:36:27:600">I&apos;m happy if you two<br/>can set up the company. Come on.</p>
<p begin="00:36:27:680" end="00:36:29:400">I just want to do whatever I can to help.</p>
<p begin="00:36:29:600" end="00:36:31:200">Did you borrow the money?</p>
<p begin="00:36:31:280" end="00:36:34:920">Don&apos;t ask. Come on, Lai.<br/>Keep the money for Yuk.</p>
<p begin="00:36:35:040" end="00:36:36:640">Thank you, Brother Yung.<br/>OK.</p>
<p begin="00:36:36:960" end="00:36:40:520">Brother Yung, why don&apos;t I<br/>add you as a shareholder?</p>
<p begin="00:36:40:600" end="00:36:42:800">Don&apos;t bother. I&apos;m a civil servant.</p>
<p begin="00:36:42:880" end="00:36:44:520">I have to apply for approval<br/>if I want to run a business.</p>
<p begin="00:36:44:560" end="00:36:45:480">It&apos;s troublesome.</p>
<p begin="00:36:45:520" end="00:36:47:080">I&apos;ll repay you once I&apos;ve made money.</p>
<p begin="00:36:47:120" end="00:36:50:000">If you want to return my favor,<br/>then be good to my younger sister.</p>
<p begin="00:36:50:760" end="00:36:56:160">Good prospects and luck...</p>
<p begin="00:37:00:720" end="00:37:01:800">Mentor.</p>
<p begin="00:37:02:080" end="00:37:03:280">You came up for fresh air too?</p>
<p begin="00:37:03:320" end="00:37:05:280">I just read the cases<br/>that happened ten years ago.</p>
<p begin="00:37:05:360" end="00:37:06:720">I found out that Cheuk Yuk<br/>and his company</p>
<p begin="00:37:06:920" end="00:37:08:240">were involved in lots of court cases.</p>
<p begin="00:37:08:280" end="00:37:10:040">But he managed to get away every time.</p>
<p begin="00:37:10:120" end="00:37:13:840">That&apos;s true. He has a team of lawyers<br/>backing him.</p>
<p begin="00:37:13:960" end="00:37:17:720">The accountants provide advice to him.<br/>He&apos;s hard to deal with.</p>
<p begin="00:37:17:840" end="00:37:19:240">What about the Gat Ling case?</p>
<p begin="00:37:19:320" end="00:37:21:040">It was the first time<br/>Cheuk Yuk was checked, right?</p>
<p begin="00:37:21:120" end="00:37:22:800">The investigation of that case<br/>has been terminated already.</p>
<p begin="00:37:22:880" end="00:37:26:200">But I&apos;m really curious.<br/>There are many points of doubt.</p>
<p begin="00:37:26:280" end="00:37:30:480">The police can&apos;t find someone guilty<br/>based on conjecture. We need evidence.</p>
<p begin="00:37:30:560" end="00:37:32:040">Get back to work.</p>
<p begin="00:37:36:080" end="00:37:38:040">Hey, get the drink yourself.<br/>OK.</p>
<p begin="00:37:38:440" end="00:37:41:840">Sheung-fei, I know you&apos;re on a diet.<br/>So I bought less tonight.</p>
<p begin="00:37:41:920" end="00:37:43:920">Why did you buy so many things?</p>
<p begin="00:37:44:120" end="00:37:48:040">Go ahead. Hey, Chi Nga,<br/>we&apos;re waiting for you. Come on down.</p>
<p begin="00:37:50:480" end="00:37:51:440">Coming.</p>
<p begin="00:37:53:320" end="00:37:55:440">Are you OK?<br/>I&apos;m fine.</p>
<p begin="00:37:55:520" end="00:37:57:000">You can&apos;t kill me by throwing chips at me.</p>
<p begin="00:37:57:160" end="00:37:58:800">Bingo.</p>
<p begin="00:37:59:720" end="00:38:02:040">Do you know from the accounts I checked,</p>
<p begin="00:38:02:080" end="00:38:05:520">I realize that many of Brainman&apos;s<br/>subsidiary companies are registered in BVI.</p>
<p begin="00:38:05:600" end="00:38:09:600">They&apos;re protected there.<br/>It&apos;s difficult to check their accounts.</p>
<p begin="00:38:09:640" end="00:38:12:000">I checked the telephone records of<br/>Brainman&apos;s management.</p>
<p begin="00:38:12:080" end="00:38:13:000">I didn&apos;t find anyone suspicious.</p>
<p begin="00:38:13:080" end="00:38:16:000">I checked their financial statements<br/>for the whole year. I didn&apos;t find anything.</p>
<p begin="00:38:18:480" end="00:38:20:480">Hey, I did work too.</p>
<p begin="00:38:20:640" end="00:38:23:600">Before I got off today, I sent<br/>some of the signatures for verification.</p>
<p begin="00:38:23:680" end="00:38:26:520">See if there&apos;s any false instrument.<br/>I&apos;m still waiting for the report.</p>
<p begin="00:38:26:680" end="00:38:29:480">He&apos;s a financial crocodile.<br/>That means he&apos;s way too smart.</p>
<p begin="00:38:29:600" end="00:38:30:960">If he knows we&apos;re checking him,</p>
<p begin="00:38:31:080" end="00:38:33:680">he&apos;ll exhaust all means<br/>to hide the evidence.</p>
<p begin="00:38:33:720" end="00:38:35:800">I thought we could take down<br/>this Cheuk Yuk.</p>
<p begin="00:38:35:840" end="00:38:37:440">I didn&apos;t realize it would be so difficult.</p>
<p begin="00:38:37:520" end="00:38:38:600">That means there&apos;s nothing we can do.</p>
<p begin="00:38:38:680" end="00:38:40:960">I&apos;ve got something. Look.</p>
<p begin="00:38:47:400" end="00:38:48:240">Look at this sum of $30 million.</p>
<p begin="00:38:48:360" end="00:38:51:320">It was transferred through the banks<br/>of several countries.</p>
<p begin="00:38:51:360" end="00:38:53:080">It was deposited on 3 different occasions.</p>
<p begin="00:38:53:160" end="00:38:56:880">But the date matches exactly when<br/>Engola bought out Big Light Year.</p>
<p begin="00:38:56:960" end="00:38:59:400">It could be the bribe that<br/>someone paid to Wong Shiu-lung.</p>
<p begin="00:38:59:480" end="00:39:00:120">No, there&apos;s a big discrepancy</p>
<p begin="00:39:00:200" end="00:39:03:720">between the sum Wong Shiu-lung told us<br/>and this sum.</p>
<p begin="00:39:03:800" end="00:39:05:000">We still haven&apos;t found</p>
<p begin="00:39:05:080" end="00:39:08:120">the mysterious fake-name account<br/>used to transfer money to Cheuk Yuk.</p>
<p begin="00:39:08:520" end="00:39:10:000">Maybe Wong Shiu-lung<br/>took the money for him</p>
<p begin="00:39:10:080" end="00:39:13:600">and then he paid the mastermind<br/>Cheuk Yuk in some other way.</p>
<p begin="00:39:13:680" end="00:39:15:080">Anyway if we can find out</p>
<p begin="00:39:15:160" end="00:39:16:640">who the holder of this<br/>fake-name account is,</p>
<p begin="00:39:16:760" end="00:39:18:040">there&apos;ll be a new lead<br/>to carry on with the investigation.</p>
<p begin="00:39:18:120" end="00:39:18:720">Yeah...</p>
<p begin="00:39:18:840" end="00:39:20:160">Anyway what you say is lousier.</p>
<p begin="00:39:20:280" end="00:39:22:880">Who&apos;s lousy?</p>
<p begin="00:39:26:400" end="00:39:31:640">How are you? Is CCB still investigating you?<br/>Are you OK?</p>
<p begin="00:39:31:760" end="00:39:33:280">It&apos;s good that you&apos;re fine.</p>
<p begin="00:39:33:440" end="00:39:36:760">But why is your staff<br/>Wong Shiu-lung testifying against you?</p>
<p begin="00:39:36:840" end="00:39:38:760">Is there enmity between you two?</p>
<p begin="00:39:38:840" end="00:39:40:080">Maybe it&apos;s because I yelled at him<br/>all the time.</p>
<p begin="00:39:40:160" end="00:39:44:120">Has it ever occurred to you that<br/>you and I got into trouble at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:39:44:280" end="00:39:46:880">and CCB came to search<br/>our companies all of a sudden.</p>
<p begin="00:39:47:040" end="00:39:53:520">Do you think someone tipped them off<br/>to smear our reputation? Chai Pui-fun!</p>
<p begin="00:39:53:560" end="00:39:54:760">Chairlady Chai?</p>
<p begin="00:39:54:920" end="00:39:56:720">That woman&apos;s worried<br/>we might go after her post.</p>
<p begin="00:39:56:920" end="00:40:00:440">So she&apos;s been looking for a chance<br/>to get incriminating material against us.</p>
<p begin="00:40:00:560" end="00:40:03:880">Women are troublesome.</p>
<p begin="00:40:03:920" end="00:40:05:880">Damon, why don&apos;t we work together?</p>
<p begin="00:40:06:080" end="00:40:08:960">Help me get the post of chairman.</p>
<p begin="00:40:09:040" end="00:40:12:560">I&apos;ll help you advance.<br/>Let&apos;s work together to kick this woman out.</p>
<p begin="00:40:12:640" end="00:40:18:600">Good. But can you include me in your<br/>North East Development project?</p>
<p begin="00:40:19:560" end="00:40:23:400">No problem.But people are still arguing a<br/>bout it.</p>
<p begin="00:40:23:520" end="00:40:27:400">Let&apos;s talk about the project later. Cheers.</p>
<p begin="00:40:47:400" end="00:40:49:280">You&apos;re home so early tonight?</p>
<p begin="00:40:49:480" end="00:40:53:960">That old chap was so boring and outdated.<br/>Has Sonny eaten yet?</p>
<p begin="00:40:54:080" end="00:40:55:600">I&apos;ve fed it already...</p>
<p begin="00:40:58:920" end="00:41:02:280">Those who don&apos;t know you would never imagine<br/>you&apos;re so different at home.</p>
<p begin="00:41:02:360" end="00:41:04:760">Of course I want to be myself<br/>when I&apos;m at home. Where&apos;s Ginnie?</p>
<p begin="00:41:04:800" end="00:41:05:680">Has she returned from her trip yet?</p>
<p begin="00:41:05:720" end="00:41:06:760">You want to see her about something?</p>
<p begin="00:41:06:840" end="00:41:09:200">A friend wants to buy her<br/>hydroponic vegetables.</p>
<p begin="00:41:09:320" end="00:41:11:080">You&apos;re already so busy.</p>
<p begin="00:41:11:160" end="00:41:13:280">You still have time to get business<br/>for your younger sister?</p>
<p begin="00:41:13:320" end="00:41:14:640">She&apos;s my only family.</p>
<p begin="00:41:14:680" end="00:41:16:080">What?</p>
<p begin="00:41:17:080" end="00:41:23:400">In my definition, my wife&apos;s not family.<br/>She&apos;s my lover. Come on.</p>
<p begin="00:41:26:240" end="00:41:28:720">What? You want to complete it sooner?</p>
<p begin="00:41:28:840" end="00:41:31:680">Yes. You let me put one piece on it<br/>only when I&apos;ve accomplished something big.</p>
<p begin="00:41:31:760" end="00:41:34:120">You agreed to play this game.</p>
<p begin="00:41:34:360" end="00:41:38:200">I know you wanted to use this game<br/>to make me work harder.</p>
<p begin="00:41:38:280" end="00:41:40:520">But sometimes when I think about it,</p>
<p begin="00:41:40:600" end="00:41:42:680">I wonder if I&apos;ve given too much for it.</p>
<p begin="00:41:42:760" end="00:41:45:920">You want to quit? That&apos;s not like you.</p>
<p begin="00:41:46:000" end="00:41:48:360">When did I say I wanted to quit?<br/>This game is so fun.</p>
<p begin="00:41:48:480" end="00:41:51:480">SMAC approves the listing of companies.</p>
<p begin="00:41:51:800" end="00:41:55:160">The higher I climb,<br/>the greater my influence.</p>
<p begin="00:41:55:320" end="00:42:00:960">Then I can determine which company<br/>gets listed as I like.</p>
<p begin="00:42:01:000" end="00:42:02:640">That&apos;s so much fun.</p>
<p begin="00:42:02:800" end="00:42:04:880">Then you need to kick Sin Cho-wai out<br/>as soon as possible.</p>
<p begin="00:42:29:720" end="00:42:32:440">Both Lai and I were wrong about you.</p>
<p begin="00:42:33:360" end="00:42:36:040">Why did my younger sister die so early?</p>
<p begin="00:42:37:400" end="00:42:41:880">Because you were greedy.<br/>You opted to be a devil.</p>
<p begin="00:42:41:960" end="00:42:42:680">I didn&apos;t break the law.</p>
<p begin="00:42:42:760" end="00:42:43:440">You cops have the duty</p>
<p begin="00:42:43:480" end="00:42:44:560">to find evidence to prove<br/>if I&apos;ve broken the law.</p>
<p begin="00:42:44:640" end="00:42:45:720">It&apos;s not for me to say.</p>
<p begin="00:42:45:760" end="00:42:47:640">Just wait and see.<br/>I will investigate you.</p>
<p begin="00:42:47:720" end="00:42:49:080">I don&apos;t want to talk to you anymore.</p>
<p begin="00:42:49:320" end="00:42:50:320">ã€€</p></div>
